# AHKFocus

### Why does this exist.
The simple awnser is I wanted to have a simple way to help other get into Auto Hot Key like I did, I was trying to use some open source softwere called Stream-PI and I could not execute programs easily and I could not focus them with the same button. But in the video I discovered Stream-PI from he (Hardware Haven) mentioned how he just used AHK scripts to fix some of the problems he had, and after a hour of work I had some scripts to do what I wanted.

### Your turn! 
Now there is some Provided examples I use that are desinged to be executed as exe files. But you will need some form of macro-pad to use them, One solution is Stream-PI like I use, they have a android client and one for Linux and some others. They even include the source code for you to compile if you would so dare.

Besides that issue the provided examples I made for personal use will be in a folder just for you to use, They include Focus/Using Steam, Discord, and Opera GX. The only change you will need to make is to change the path. For most you just will have to replace "ninja" in the file path with what ever it is for your file path. to find what you need to replace "ninja" with go to your's C: disk, Then users, And from their find your user it is NOT Public, If there is multiple users then consult other sources as I will not go too far in detail here.

Write down your folder name for your user We will need it!

Now after you get your profile folder name Test it out! you will need to install AutoHotKey version 1.1. get it at https://www.autohotkey.com. And a text editor Notepad will work fine but I will be using VS Code with the AHK++ plugin. Now the AHK script I will be using as my example is my Focus script for steam, it is almost the same for all the examples I provided and some others you can make yourself. 
Remember the folder name I told you to remember? Now we will use it. So replace "ninja" with what ever your's was. it is capital sensitive so be careful!

This is roughly what it will look like! After that save your work (Ctrl+S on most editors!) and Run it using AHK 1.1! If it runs flawlessly then you can Right click it and hit "Compile Script" in the option menu.

Now that you did that run the exe and make sure it works and from there you can use it on a MacroPad!
